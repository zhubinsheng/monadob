/*!
 * Helper to estimate the offset between two clocks using exponential smoothing.
 *
 * Given a sample from two timestamp domains A and B that should have been
 * sampled as close as possible, together with an estimate of the offset between
 * A clock and B clock (or zero), it applies a smoothing average on the
 * estimated offset and returns @p a in B clock.
 *
 * @param freq About how many times per second this function is called. Helps setting a good decay value.
 * @param a Timestamp in clock A of the event
 * @param b Timestamp in clock B of the event
 * @param[in,out] inout_a2b Pointer to the current offset estimate from A to B, or 0 if unknown.
 * Value pointed-to will be updated.
 * @return timepoint_ns @p a in B clock
